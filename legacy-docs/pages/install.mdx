# How to install

1. First, sign up on our [website](www.legacy.xyz) and enter in your project information so your project can be discoverable by other signers across the internet.
2. Once you've signed up, install our npm package onto your front-end folder `npm install legacy-xyz`.

Now, legacy.xyz comes with 2 components: `guestLists` component (displays all the signatures of everyone who's visited your site), and an `addGuestListButton` that prompts users to sign.

3. To import the components

```js
import {GuestListComponent, addGuestListButton} from @addGuestListButton;
```
